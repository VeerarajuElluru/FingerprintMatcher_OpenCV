* This Python project utilizes the OpenCV framework to create a Fingerprint Matcher.<br>
* Fingerprint recognition is a crucial component of biometric authentication, and this project aims to provide a simple yet plausible solution for matching real and altered 
fingerprints. With OpenCV's image processing capabilities, this project can process fingerprint images, extract unique features, and compare them for identification purposes.<br>
* Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and adapt it to your specific use cases.
* Special thanks to NeuralNine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIvfqfKkiio for guiding me on my first ever object detection project
