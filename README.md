# FingerprintMatcher_OpenCV
This Python project utilizes the OpenCV framework to create a Fingerprint Matcher.
Fingerprint recognition is a crucial component of biometric authentication, and this project aims to provide a simple yet plausible solution for matching real and altered 
fingerprints. With OpenCV's image processing capabilities, this project can process fingerprint images, extract unique features, and compare them for identification purposes.
Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and adapt it to your specific use cases.
